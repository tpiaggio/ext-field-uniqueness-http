Use this extension to ensure uniqueness on a specified field (for example, username) of a document within a specified to a Cloud Firestore collection (for example, users).

This extension allows you to write a document to your specified Cloud Firestore collection using a Callable HTTP function. If you add a string to a specified field in the document within that collection, this extension:

- Gets the type of event sent to the callable function and the string value of the specified field.
- Writes the document to the specified collection if the value of the specified field is unique.
- Creates or deletes a document with that value as it's key on a separate specified aux collection

#### How to use

This extension works using a callable function to write documents to the collection, instead of writing directly from the client app. The goal of this extension is to maintain documents on an aux collection, each document having the unique field value as the key, and thus checking for uniqueness of these documents using a transaction on the server.

In the following example, we'll be using _users_ and _username_ as the collection and field respectively, but it could be any field name and collection name.

```js
const data = {
  change: "CREATE",
  collection: "users",
  fieldName: "username"
  document: {
    id,
    username
  }
};

const callable = firebase.functions().httpsCallable("ext-field-uniqueness-http-fieldUniqueness");
callable(data)
.then((result) => {
  // User created successfully
})
.catch((error) => {
  // Username already taken
});
```

You should also indicate in your security rules that the collection, in this example called _users_, should have `allow write: if false;` as a security rule, since we don't want to allow the client to write to this collection, only the HTTP callable function should be writing to it.

#### Additional setup

Before installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.

#### Billing
